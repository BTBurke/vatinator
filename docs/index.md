# Getting Started

You have questions.  I have answers.  After you read this, check out the [User Guide](user-guide.md).

## What is this thing? 

Vatinator fills out your Estonian VAT reimbursement forms.  It:

* Extracts data from your receipts
* Fills out your VAT refund and excise forms
* Puts your receipts into a PDF in the format expected by the tax authority

To get the best results, please read the [User Guide](user-guide.md).

## How does it work?

1. Upload one picture (or one PDF) for each receipt
2. Vatinator uses [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) to find data to fill your forms
3. It puts your receipts in a PDF then fills your excise and VAT reimbursement forms
4. You'll receive an email with all the files you need to submit your claim
5. Open the excel files and **verify all the data it found was correct**.  Enter any data it couldn't find.
6. Sit back and enjoy a beverage of your choice with the time you saved.

It will work better if you follow a few simple rules, so please read the [User Guide](user-guide.md).

## How much do I have to pay for this miracle of modern technology?

Nothing!  I do accept tributes in the form of scotch, whisky, beer, or bidding 360s.

## Anything else I should know?

This software strives to put the right data from your receipts into the VAT forms.  Like any software it may contain bugs or make mistakes because it didn't find the right data.  **You must check the data and verify it is correct.  I am not responsible if you submit forms with incorrect information.** 

## Hold up, what about ...?

#### Privacy

It only collects the bare minimum information necessary to fill out your VAT forms.  No tracking.  Your info is never shared with third parties.  It complies with GDPR and is hosted in the EU.

#### Security

Data is encrypted at rest, backed up encrypted, and deleted when it's no longer needed.  The server is locked down hard and I guarantee it's more secure than OpenNet.

#### How it's built

It's built by a guy you know using battle-tested technologies and 20 years of (semi-professional) programming experience.  Countless hours have been spent so that you and I don't have to hand-type crap into excel forms. 

## How can I help?

[Send me](mailto:bryan@vatinator.com) ideas for making it better or a funny testimonial I can put on the home page.

## How do I report a bug?

Vatinator automatically collects bug reports when it can't find the data it's looking for.  Over time, it will keep getting better.  Hang tight while I improve it.  If you get a big red banner across the top, [email me with a screenshot](mailto:bryan@vatinator.com).


## What if I still need help?
